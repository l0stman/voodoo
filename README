This is a proof-of-concept event-driven chat server implemented using
kqueue under FreeBSD.  In the description of the protocol used, <CRLF>
represents a carriage return followed by a new line.  And the defined
commands (the trailing <CRLF> included) are limited to 1024 bytes.

The client should login first upon connecting to the server with the
following command:
        LOGIN <username><CRLF>

The other commands at the disposal of the clients are:
JOIN <#chatroom><CRLF>
        Create a new chatroom or join an existing one.

PART <#chatroom><CRLF>
        Leave the chatroom.

MSG <#chatroom><message-text><CRLF>
        Send a message to a chatroom.  All the users in the chatroom receive
        the message.

MSG <username><message-text><CRLF>
        Send a message to the given user.

LOGOUT<CRLF>
        Logout of the chat server.

The server answers to a client's command with either "OK<CRLF>" if the
command is successful or "ERROR <reason><CRLF>" otherwise.  When a
message is sent to a chatroom a client is in, he receives the
following message from the server:
        GOTROOMMSG <sender> #<chatroom> <message-text><CRLF>

In the case where another user sent a message directly to the client,
the server sends:
        GOTUSERMSG <sender> <message-text><CRLF>
